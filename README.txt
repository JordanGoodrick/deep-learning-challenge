Overiew of my analysis: The main purpose of this model is to leverage machine learning and neural networks to attempt to predict whether or not an applicant for funding will be successful, given factors like income classification, amount of funding requested and the type of the application submitted. 

Data preprocessing goals: We are targeting the IS_SUCCESSFUL variable, as that is what is most relevant to Alphabet. I used income classification, organization type, and the funding amount requested to predict whether or not an applicant will actually be successful. I removed any identification collumns as we don't need to know which SPECIFIC projects were successful. I also removed project-specific information, like whether or not a project is currently active. Finally, I removed the special considerations column as those considerations are done on a case-by-case basis and could result in successes/failures that do not fit the rest of the model.

I used a total of 4 layers, with 256, 128, and 64 neurons contained in hidden layers with an output layer of 1 neuron. I added the additional layer with 256 neurons so that my model could pick up more complex patterns in our data. I utilized ReLU as my hidden layers' activation functions for performance reasons, and sigmoid for my output layer as I am making binary predictions. 

While I was able to increase my model's performance to ~73.2% from 72.8%, I was unable to achieve the target model performance of 75%. To increase my models performance, I reduced the number of irrelevant columns (the aforementioned activity status and special considerations), added another layer of 256 neurons to increase my models ability to learn patterns, increased the threshold of application types to need at least 1000 unique instances to avoid being bucketed under other, and increased the number of epochs ran to 100 and decreased my batch size to 8 to increase the accuracy of my weighting. 

In conclusion, my model accurately predicted an Alphabet Soup-funded project's success at a rate of ~73%. If I were to use a different kind of model instead, I might use a logistic regression, as features like application type, industry affiliation, and income amount seem to be decent indicators of a project's success.
